# nao_simulator
This simulator creates a 2D world with obstacles within which a robot can navigate. 
The Nao robot can navigate using keyboard or in autonomous mode. 
In autonomous mode the robot uses reactive forces that one should program oneself. An example is given in behaviour_based_navigation.py
and an empty without any forces is in behaviour_based_navigation_empty.py.
